NGFW/WAF in Go â€“ Project Roadmap

Project Goal:
Build a containerized reverse-proxy NGFW/WAF in Go that sits in front of SPAs or APIs. 
Features include IP/port filtering, stateful inspection, HTTP DPI, and integration with a React dashboard for live monitoring and rule management. 

Phases Overview:

Phase 0: Project Setup
- Install Go and initialize project
- Directory structure:
  /cmd, /pkg, /config, /web, /docker
- Git and Docker initialization

Phase 1: Basic Reverse Proxy
- Implement HTTP/HTTPS reverse proxy
- CLI to configure upstream URLs/ports
- Logging requests/responses
- Test with SPA/API backend

Phase 2: Network-Level Firewall
- IP/Port filtering
- CLI commands to add/remove rules
- Whitelist/blacklist support
- Test filtering functionality

Phase 3: Stateful Inspection
- Maintain connection table (srcIP:port -> dstIP:port -> state)
- Session timeout and cleanup
- Detect anomalous TCP sequences
- CLI to list active connections

Phase 4: HTTP Deep Packet Inspection (DPI)
- Inspect HTTP headers, cookies, query params, body
- Predefined and custom rules
- CLI to manage rules
- Logging and alerting blocked traffic

Phase 5: React Dashboard Integration
- Visualize traffic, rules, alerts
- API endpoints in Go for live feed and rule management
- WebSocket/Server-Sent Events for real-time updates
- Sync CLI changes with dashboard

Phase 6: Containerization & Deployment
- Dockerfile for Go app
- docker-compose to launch firewall + backend
- CLI to start/stop containerized firewall
- Test with multiple web projects

Phase 7: Optimization & Security Hardening
- Connection pooling and concurrency improvements
- Memory and state table optimization
- Panic recovery, input validation, timeout handling
- Optional: eBPF integration

Phase 8: CLI Usability Enhancements
- Use cobra or urfave/cli
- Subcommands:
  start, stop, rules add/remove, connections list, logs tail
- Interactive mode for rule testing

Phase 9: Documentation & Testing
- README with setup, CLI commands, examples
- Unit tests for core modules
- Integration tests with SPA/API backends
- Example Docker setups

Deliverable:
- Fully functional, containerized NGFW/WAF
- CLI interface and React dashboard
- Ready to wrap any web project via Docker
